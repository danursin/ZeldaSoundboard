# Zelda Soundboard

## Inspiration
My friend, Max, was having a birthday and we wanted to show him a good time.

In addition to the scavenger hunt that was planned, we decided that we needed some Legend of Zelda sounds to make it all hit home.

Luckily, my friend Mark and I had little to do but work on this little soundboard app. Some sounds we could source online and others we recorded on a phone while playing the game.

This particular iteration was rewritten after I found the original Cordova/Ionic app source from ~2016 and gave it a faithful refresh.
