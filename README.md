# Zelda Soundboard

## Inspiration
My friend, Max, was having a birthday and we wanted to show him a good time.

In addition to the scavenger hunt that was planned, we decided that we needed some Legend of Zelda sounds to make it all hit home.

Luckily, my friend Mark and I had little to do but work on this little soundboard app. Some sounds we could source online and others we recorded on a phone while playing the game.

This particular iteration was rewritten after I found the original Cordova/Ionic app source from ~2016 and gave it a faithful refresh.

## Sounds
* **Link Attack** - Randomly plays one of five attack sounds
* **Epona** - Epona whinnying sound
* **Ganondorf** - Ganondorf laughing
* **Goron** - Alternates between Goron "up"and "down" sound
* **Heart Piece** - Plays the "new heart piece" sound followed by the small heart sound. For each click, it plays an additional small heart sound, like when adding a heart container in OAT.
* **Link Dying** - Classic sound of Link dying
* **Navi** Alternates "Hey!" and "Hello!". On the fifth click, plays "Listen!"
* **Secret Discovery** - The "secret discovered" sound
* **Skill Kid** - Plays the Skull Kid laughing sound
* **Small Heart** - Small heart sound
* **Treasure Chest** - Large treasure chest sound
* **Whoa Whoa** - Link steps off a cliff but catches himself
